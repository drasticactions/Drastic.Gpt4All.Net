# Drastic.Gpt4All.Net

Drastic.Gpt4All.Net is an experimental .NET Binding of Gpt4All, using their bindings as a baseline and including additional runtime libraries to use it on more platforms. I've also included the library loader from [Whisper.Net](https://github.com/sandrohanea/whisper.net) for loading your own copies of Gpt4All dynamically. 

This is code that will, hopfully, make its way into Gpt4All, but I want to make sure it works well on its own.

The runtime libraries are located at [gpt4all.net.Runtime](https://github.com/drasticactions/gpt4all.net.Runtime).
