# Drastic.Gpt4All.Net

Drastic.Gpt4All.Net is an experimental .NET console and MAUI app using Gpt4All, including additional runtime libraries to use it on more platforms. The code is based off of a PR I am currently working on in their [repo](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all/pull/763).

This is code that will, hopfully, make its way into Gpt4All, but I want to make sure it works well on its own.

The runtime libraries are located at [gpt4all.net.Runtime](https://github.com/drasticactions/gpt4all.net.Runtime).
